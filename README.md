# AWS JWT Authorizer
An AWS API Gateway custom authorizer to validate JWTs created by BYU's WSO2.

## Usage
If you are in the NotifyMe AWS domain, or in other words, if you sign in to the AWS console using this link: https://notify-me-byu.signin.aws.amazon.com, then all you need to do is follow these instructions to create a custom authorizer for your API that uses the `verifyWSO2JWT` lambda function. If you are not in the NotifyMe AWS domain, or in other words, you do not sign into the AWS console using: https://notify-me-byu.signin.aws.amazon.com, then you will need to follow these instructions to first create and upload this lambda function in your AWS domain, then create a custom authorizer for your API that uses this lambda function.
